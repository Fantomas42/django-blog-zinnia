Search Engines
==============

Zinnia like almost all blogging systems contains a search engine feature.

But in fact there are 2 search engines, a basic and an advanced, 
you can choose the engine you want to use, but you can't use both in the same time.

Basic Search Engine
-------------------

The basic search engine is the original engine of Zinnia, and will be used
if the advanced engine cannot be used.

It will always returns more results than the advanced engine, because each terms
of the query will be searched in the entries and the results are added to a main
result list. We can say that the results are inclusives.

Example of a query :
  *love paris*

This will returns all the entries containing the terms 'love' or 'paris'.


Advanced Search Engine
----------------------

The advanced search engine has several possibilities for making more elaborated queries,
with it's own grammar system.

The grammar of the search is close to the main search engines like Google or Yahoo.

The main difference with the basic engine is that the results are exclusives.

For enabling the advanced search engine, you simply need to install the **pyparsing** package.
Otherelse the basic engine will be used.


Here a list of examples and possibilities :

  * Example of a query with terms :
      *love paris*    

   This will returns all the entries containing the terms 'love' and 'paris'.

  * Example of a query with excluded terms :
      *paris -hate*

    This will returns all the entries containing the term 'paris' without the term 'hate'.

  * Example of a query with expressions :
      *"Paris, I love you"*
 
    This will returns all the entries containing the expression "Paris, I love you".

  * Example of a query with **category operator** :
      *love category:paris*

    This will returns all the entries containing the term 'love' filled in the category named 'paris'.

  * Example of a query with **tag operator** :
      *paris tag:love*

    This will returns all the entries containing the term 'paris' with the tag 'love'.

  * Example of a query with **author operator** :
      *paris author:john*

    This will returns all the entries containing the term 'paris' writed by 'john'.

  * Example of a query with boolean operator :
      *paris or berlin*

    This will returns all the entries containing the term 'paris' or 'berlin'.

  * Example of e query with parenthesis :
      *(paris or berlin) love*

    This will returns all the entries containing the terms 'paris' or 'berlin' with the term 'love'.

  * Complex example :
      *((paris or berlin) and (tag:love or category:meeting) girl -money*

    This will returns all the entries containing the terms 'paris' or 'berlin' with the tag 'love'
    or filled under the category 'meeting' also containing the term 'girl' excluding entries
    with the term 'money'.
